# File Hash Verification System

## Overview

The FileShare application now includes comprehensive file integrity verification using MD5 and SHA256 hashes. This ensures that files are transferred completely without corruption and maintains data integrity throughout the upload and download process.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Automatic Hash Calculation
- **MD5 Hash**: 32-character hexadecimal string for quick integrity checks
- **SHA256 Hash**: 64-character hexadecimal string for cryptographic security
- **Automatic Calculation**: Hashes are calculated automatically after every file upload
- **Chunked Upload Support**: Hashes are calculated after all chunks are combined

### 2. File Integrity Verification
- **Pre-download Verification**: Files are verified before allowing download
- **Real-time Status**: Integrity status is displayed in the admin panel
- **Corruption Detection**: Automatically detects and reports corrupted files

### 3. Admin Panel Enhancements
- **Integrity Status Column**: Shows verification status for each file
- **Hash Information**: Displays MD5 and SHA256 hashes in file details
- **Bulk Actions**: 
  - Verify integrity of multiple files
  - Recalculate hashes for selected files
  - Export file information including hash data
- **Individual File Actions**: Verify integrity of individual files

### 4. Download Headers
- **X-File-MD5**: MD5 hash included in download response headers
- **X-File-SHA256**: SHA256 hash included in download response headers
- **Client Verification**: Users can verify downloaded files using these hashes

### 5. User Verification Tool
- **Web-based Verification**: JavaScript tool on the About page
- **File Upload Interface**: Users can upload downloaded files for verification
- **Hash Comparison**: Compares calculated hash with expected hash
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear success/failure indicators

## How It Works

### Upload Process
1. User uploads a file (regular or chunked)
2. File is saved to storage
3. System calculates MD5 and SHA256 hashes
4. Hashes are stored in the database
5. Success message confirms integrity verification

### Download Process
1. User requests file download
2. System verifies file integrity using stored hashes
3. If verification fails, download is blocked with error message
4. If verification passes, file is served with hash headers
5. Download count is incremented

### Verification Process
1. User downloads file and notes hash values from headers
2. User visits About page and uses verification tool
3. User uploads downloaded file and enters expected hash
4. System calculates hash of uploaded file
5. System compares hashes and shows verification result

## Database Schema

### New Fields Added
```sql
ALTER TABLE file_sharing_fileupload 
ADD COLUMN md5_hash VARCHAR(32) NULL,
ADD COLUMN sha256_hash VARCHAR(64) NULL;
```

### Field Descriptions
- **md5_hash**: 32-character MD5 hash for quick integrity checks
- **sha256_hash**: 64-character SHA256 hash for cryptographic security
